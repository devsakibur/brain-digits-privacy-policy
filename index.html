  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the BrainDigits mobile application (the "App") handles your data. By using BrainDigits, you agree to the terms described here.</p>

  <h2>1. Overview of the App</h2>
  <p>BrainDigits is a math-based educational game that helps users enhance their arithmetic and logical reasoning skills. The app generates subtraction-based quizzes and tracks user progress locally on the device.</p>

  <h2>2. Personal Data Collection</h2>

  <h2>3. Offline Usage</h2>
  <p>The app works completely offline. No internet connection is required to play or access any part of the application.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Stored on Device</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Local game progress (like scores or settings) is stored on your device using internal storage or SharedPreferences.</li>
    <li>This data is never transmitted over the internet or shared with third parties.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>This app does not use any third-party services such as Google Analytics, Firebase, or ad networks. Therefore, no third-party SDKs or APIs are accessing your data.</p>
